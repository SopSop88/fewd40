	<h2> Favorite Foods </h2>
	<p> I recently tried eating Philipino food with my hands and it was really tasty. My favorite types of cuisine are Japanese, Thai, Italian and American. My favorite foods are sashimi, strawberry shortcake, poached eggs, and fresh pasta. </p>

	<h3> My Last 3 Meals in Oakland </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Belly | 1901 San Pablo Ave, Oakland
			<p> This is my new favorite fusion restaurant. Their Korean-Mexican burritos are really tasty and affordable. They also make lychee aqua fresca, fries, tacos and ice cream mochi.</p>

			Longtitude | 347 14th Street, Oakland
			<p> I went to a great 40's birthday party here! They do a mean punch and a variety of tasty, fried appetizers. </p>

			Lungomare | 1 Broadway, Oakland 
			<p> On Sundays, they have 3-course meals + endless wine for only $30. It's a great deal and servers are very nice! </p>
